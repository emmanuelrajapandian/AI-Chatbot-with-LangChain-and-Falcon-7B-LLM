        "Venturing on the journey of creating an AI chatbot, I leveraged the capabilities of LangChain, 8-bit quantized Falcon-7B LLM, Chroma DB to create a sophisticated chatbot developed and equipped with the capacity to learn from the external world through **R**etrieval **A**ugmented **G**eneration (RAG).\n",

This dataset forms the bedrock, enabling the chatbot to respond adeptly to queries regarding the queries related to speed-cubing, its rules and guidelines.\n",

        "Dealing with sizable documents or websites presents a challenge for RAG, given that they may exceed the context window. To address this, document splitting is employed to break down large documents into more manageable chunks. This approach not only facilitates the retriever in selecting more pertinent chunks from the document but also avoids overwhelming a language model with the entirety of the data. This section introduces the use of the `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`, which serves as the default text splitter. The `RecursiveTextSplitter` method involves taking a list of separators, initiating the split based on the first separator, and progressing to the next one if the resulting chunk size remains excessive."
